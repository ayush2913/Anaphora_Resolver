Anaphora Resolver
=================

Introduction
------------
This project is aimed at building an **Anaphora Resolver** for the Hindi 
Language. This is a part of a challenge faced in the field of Natural Language 
Processing. Anaphora is an expression that refers to another expression
(Antecedent) that has occured previously.

	Example
	Ram saw a *laptop* yesterday. He wants to buy it.
	
In the above example we have 2 anaphoras, **He** and **it**
Now, with our world knowledge we already know that **He**
refers to *Ram* and similarly, **it** refers to *laptop*

	To resolve such relations in a large text corpus is called
	Anaphora Resolution
